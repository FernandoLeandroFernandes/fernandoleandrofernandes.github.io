Hi there! This blog is my personal space to share with everyone some of my works and thoughts.

My name is Fernando Fernandes, married and father of awesome boys.

I've been working in the software industry for some good years developing solutions for governamental law agencies in Brazil since I graduated from a Technical Federal College ([IFRN][ifrn]) in Computer Science (minor in Industrial Automation).

I've been approved in 2004 in a public nation wide contest for Computer Specialist / Software Developer @ [Brazilian General Attorneyâ€™s Office][mpf]. 

I am writting my final paper for a major degree in Mechatronics Engineering from one of the greatest Federal Brazilian Universities ([UFRN][ufrn-ct]), the best in the northeast country region.
